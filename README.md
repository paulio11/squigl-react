# Squigl v2

Squigl v2 is the next evolution of my Twitter/X clone, rebuilt from the ground up with a modern tech stack. This time, Iâ€™ve split it into two parts: a
**Django REST Framework** back-end for a robust API and a **React** front-end for a seamless user experience. Built on the foundation of my [Banana repository](https://github.com/paulio11/banana).

[Squigl v1](https://github.com/paulio11/P4-Squigl-Twitter-Clone)

## Features

On top of everything in [Banana](https://github.com/paulio11/banana), Squigl v2 includes:

- Post creation (image and/or text)
- Automatic hashtag, user profile links, and URL generation in posts
- Post editing and deletion
- Post liking
- Replying, editing, and deleting replies
- Reply liking
- Individual post pages with replies
- User profile pages
- User following and unfollowing
- Private user-to-user messaging
- Message read/unread status
- Message deletion
- Trending hashtags calculated from posts
- Listing unfollowed users
- Post and user searching
- User profile customisation

### Upcoming Features

To make v2 have feature parity with v1 I still need to add the following:

- Post reporting
- Moderation dashboard
- Optimised views for mobile and tablet
